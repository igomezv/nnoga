# Neural Networks Optimized by Genetic Algorithms for Data Analysis (NNOGADA) 

**nnogada** is a Python package that perform a hyperparemeter tuning for artificial neural networks using a simple genetic algorithms. Useful for generate better neural network models for data analysis.


## Description of this repository

- nnogada has the source code of the neural approximator with simple genetic algorithms.
- In data folder we have some data used in tests.
