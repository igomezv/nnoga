# Neural Networks Optimized by Genetic Algorithms for Data Analysis (NNOGADA) 

**nnogada** is a Python package that performs hyperparemeter tuning for artificial neural networks, particularly for Multi Layer Perceptrons, using simple genetic algorithms. Useful for generate better neural network models for data analysis. Currently, only works with feedforward neural networks in tensorflow.keras.

If you use the code, please cite the paper [arxiv:2209.02685].

## Description of this repository

- nnogada folder has the source code of the neural approximator with simple genetic algorithms.
- In data folder we have some data used in tests. 

**Note:** Final examples will be added when the paper is accepted.

## TODO 

- Include convolutional, recurrent neural networks and other architectures.
- To allow pytorch models.
