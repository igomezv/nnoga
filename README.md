# neurapprox

**neurapprox** is a Python package that generates neural network approximations for analytical functions, or functions intrinsic to datase. The hyperparameters tunning are made with genetic algorithms. 



## Description of this repository

- neurapprox has the source code of the neural approximator with simple genetic algorithms.
- In data folder we have some data used in tests.
